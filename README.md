## DATASET
The project utilizes the **Air Quality UCI Dataset**, collected from an array of chemical sensors stationed in an Italian city:
- **CO(GT)**: True hourly averaged carbon monoxide concentration ($mg/m^3$)
- **NMHC(GT)**: Non-methanic hydrocarbons concentration ($mg/m^3$)
- **C6H6(GT)**: True hourly averaged Benzene concentration ($\mu g/m^3$)
- **NOx(GT)**: True hourly averaged Nitrogen oxides concentration ($ppb$)
- **NO2(GT)**: True hourly averaged Nitrogen dioxide concentration ($\mu g/m^3$)
- **PT08_S1 to PT08_S5**: Sensor resistance responses (Tin oxide, Titania, Tungsten oxide, Indium oxide)
- **T / RH / AH**: Temperature (°C), Relative Humidity (%), and Absolute Humidity

## HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS
- **Good (🟢)**: Outdoor activities are safe. Natural ventilation is encouraged.
- **Moderate (🟡)**: Sensitive individuals (asthma, children, elderly) should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. Consider protective masks.
- **Poor (🔴)**: Avoid outdoor activities. Keep windows closed, operate air filtration/purifiers, and wear protective masks if going outside.
